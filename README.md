E-Commerce Website : QuickBuy        

My capstone project, "QuickBuy" is a hybrid e-commerce platform inspired by the speed of Blinkit and the comprehensive selection of Amazon. It combines instant delivery with traditional e-commerce, offering users a diverse shopping experience. QuickBuy addresses the need for both immediate and planned purchases within a single platform, catering to users who value both speed and variety.

Problem Statement  : The problem statement focused on bridging the gap between instant delivery services and traditional online marketplaces. Users often need items quickly but also desire a wide selection and the ability to plan purchases in advance. QuickBuy aims to solve this by offering both quick and standard delivery options, streamlining the shopping process and providing a single platform for all shopping needs.

My approach involved several key steps -  I designed the QuickBuy logo and website layout using Canvas. The front-end was developed using React, with Redux for state management to handle product data, cart items, wishlist items, user authentication, and admin/seller dashboard data. Tailwind CSS provided styling for a responsive design. 

Key components of QuickBuy include : 
E-commerce Dashboard: The landing page features a header with the QuickBuy logo, search bar, cart and wishlist icons, and login/signup options. A banner section introduces the platform. Products are categorized by "Quick Delivery" and "Standard Delivery," and displayed accordingly. The footer contains quick links, company information and contact details.
Search Functionality: A robust search bar allows users to find products by name, displaying matching results.
Login/Signup: Secure login and signup forms are provided for users.
Product Card: Displays product image, name, price, delivery type (quick or standard), "Add to Cart" button, "Add to Wishlist" icon, and review stars.
Product Details Page: Provides comprehensive product information, including images, price, description, delivery time, key features, payment options, offers, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Cart: Displays added products, allows users to adjust quantities or remove items, calculates the total price, and offers checkout functionality.
Wishlist: Stores products added by the user for later purchase.
User Dashboard: Provides order history, profile management, and other user-specific features.
Seller Dashboard: Allows sellers to manage their products, track orders, and view sales statistics.
Admin Dashboard: Provides administrative controls for managing users, products, categories, and overall platform settings.
Payment Gateway Integration: Integration with a payment gateway (Stripe) for secure online transactions.
My conclusion is that QuickBuy successfully combines the speed of instant delivery with the variety of traditional e-commerce. The use of React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and a well-structured architecture has allowed me to create a functional and scalable application. The key features, including differentiated delivery options, user/seller/admin dashboards, and payment gateway integration, address the core needs of a modern e-commerce platform.
